        False, raise CompileError instead.
    parity: give results identical to CPython, bit for bit (default True). False trades that
        for speed where parity costs it: float / // % by zero and math functions give IEEE inf

        takes a second compile and slows the function, by 3% to 45% on our benchmarks; results don't change.
